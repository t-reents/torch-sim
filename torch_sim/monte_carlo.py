"""Propagators for Monte Carlo simulations.

This module provides functionality for performing Monte Carlo simulations,
particularly focused on swap Monte Carlo for atomic systems. It includes
implementations of the Metropolis criterion, swap generation, and utility
functions for handling permutations in batched systems.

The `swap_monte_carlo` function can be used with `integrate` but if
a trajectory is being reported, the `TorchSimTrajectory.write_state` method
must be called with `variable_masses=True`.
