"""Model Interface: Core interfaces for all simulation models in torchsim.

This module defines the abstract base class that all torchsim models must implement.
It establishes a common API for interacting with different force and energy models,
ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the underlying implementation. The module
also provides validation utilities to verify model conformance to the interface.

Example::

    # Creating a custom model that implements the interface
    class MyModel(ModelInterface):
        def __init__(self, device=None, dtype=torch.float64):
            self._device = device or torch.device(
                "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
            )
            self._dtype = dtype
            self._compute_stress = True
            self._compute_force = True

        def forward(self, positions, cell, batch, atomic_numbers=None, **kwargs):
            # Implementation that returns energy, forces, and stress
            return {"energy": energy, "forces": forces, "stress": stress}

Notes:
    Models must explicitly declare support for stress computation through the
    compute_stress property, as some integrators require stress calculations.

    This interface provides a common structure for all energy and force models,

    forces, and stresses.

    Attributes:
        device (torch.device): Device where the model runs computations.
        dtype (torch.dtype): Data type used for tensor calculations.
        compute_stress (bool): Whether the model calculates stress tensors.
        compute_force (bool): Whether the model calculates atomic forces.

    Examples:
        ```python
