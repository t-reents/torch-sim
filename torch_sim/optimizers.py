"""Optimizers for geometry relaxations.

This module provides optimization algorithms for atomic structures in a batched format,
enabling efficient relaxation of multiple atomic structures simultaneously. It includes
several gradient-based methods with support for both atomic position and unit cell
optimization.

The module offers:

* Standard gradient descent for atomic positions
* Gradient descent with unit cell optimization
* FIRE (Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine) optimization with unit cell parameters
* FIRE optimization with Frechet cell parameterization for improved cell relaxation

            - Update function that performs one FIRE step with Frechet derivatives

    Notes:
        - md_flavor="vv_fire" follows the original paper closely, including
          integration with Velocity Verlet steps. See https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.170201
          and https://github.com/Radical-AI/torch-sim/issues/90#issuecomment-2826179997
          for details.
        - md_flavor="ase_fire" mimics the implementation in ASE, which differs slightly
          in the update steps and does not explicitly use atomic masses in the
          velocity update step. See https://gitlab.com/ase/ase/-/blob/66963e6e38/ase/optimize/fire.py#L164-214
          for details.
        - Frechet cell parameterization uses matrix logarithm to represent cell
          deformations, which provides improved numerical properties for cell
          optimization
        - This method generally performs better than standard unit cell optimization
          for cases with large cell deformations
        - To fix the cell and only optimize atomic positions, set both
          constant_volume=True and hydrostatic_strain=True
